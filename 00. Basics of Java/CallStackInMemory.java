        // A: Call Stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program.
        //    It is used to implement subroutines, or in other words, to keep track of its local variables, parameters, and return addresses.
        //    The call stack is often used to implement the call stack in a computer's memory.
        //    When a subroutine is called, the information about the current state of the subroutine is pushed onto the call stack.
        //    When the subroutine returns, the information about the current state of the subroutine is popped from the call stack.

        // Q: What is the Stack Frame?
        // A: A stack frame is a part of the call stack that contains information about the current subroutine.
